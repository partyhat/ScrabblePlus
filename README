This is Scrabble++ which is a regular game of scrabble except with special 
tiles that include Lose a Turn, Reverse Order, and Negative Points.  A player
can buy special tiles with the points they have and play them on the board
somewhere.  Only the player that plays a special tile can see it, so that 
another player may land on it and enact the effect causing them to lose a turn,
get negative points, or reverse the order of the players.

The executable jar file is located in Scrabble++.zip.  Unzip this folder to run
the application.  Make sure you do not move the jar file out of the folder that
includes the assets folder and the Scrabble++_lib folder.  

Have Fun!
